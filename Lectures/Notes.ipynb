    "\n",
    "## What is computer security?\n",
    "- Computer security deals with protecting data, programs, and systems against intelligent adversaries.\n",
    "- We become increasingly interconnected, and digitalization is increasing, making the consequences of security failures catastrophic.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Safety vs Security:\n",
    "- Safety means being secure against unintended threats.\n",
    "- Security is the protection against deliberate threats.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why is security hard?\n",
    "- Security is hard to test for.\n",
    "- Building secure applications requires deep understanding of all technologies involved in the design and implementation of the system.\n",
    "    - One vulnerability can cripple the system.\n",
    "    - Not all dependencies are known.\n",
    "- It is not all technical, users play a role too.\n",
    "- There is asymmetry between attackers and defenders\n",
    "\n",
    "## Security principles: CIA triad\n",
    "- The CIA triad contains the three essential goals in Cyber Security.\n",
    "- Systems must be **available** to users, users should be able to **trust** (verify) that the data is correct, and data should **not be accessed by unauthorized** persons.\n",

    "### Tools for Confidentiality\n",
    "- Encryption\n",
    "    - Ensure that data cannot be read when someone gets their hands on it.\n",
    "- Access control systems\n",
    "    - Make it hard to get the data when the user is unauthorized.\n",
    "- Policies and governance\n",
    "    - Mandate secure data practices\n",
    " \n",
    "### Tools for Integrity\n",
    "- Data validation\n",
    "    - Validate data at various stages to ensure that it is still intact.\n",
    "    - Tools include Checksums, Digital signatures, Error detection and correction codes.\n",
    "- Change management and version control\n",
    "    - Control and document changes to data to ensure transparency and accountability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools for Availability\n",
    "- Redundancy and failover\n",
    "    - Design systems with backup mechanisms to mitigate single points of failure.\n",
    "- Load balancing\n",
    "    - Distribute traffic across various resources.\n",
    "- Monitoring and alerting\n",
    "    - Monitor for early signs of problems to identify system failures before they become a large issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Computer security threat\n",
    "### Threat definition\n",
    "- Threats are potential violations of security posed by attackers.\n",
    "- When evaluating the security of a program or website, it's essential to consider the context:\n",
    "    Who is the potential attacker, and what are you defending against?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Context is Crucial\n",
    "- Computer security is context-dependent and revolves around a specific attacker or threat model.\n",
    "- There is no universal solution that can defend against all types of threats.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Attackers have different profiles and motives\n",
    "- Consider different potential attackers, each with unique motivations and capabilities.\n",
    "- When evaluating the security of a program or website, it's essential to consider the context: Who is the potential attacker, and what are you defending against?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### No One-Size-Fits-All\n",
    "Recognize that security measures should be tailored to specific threats and scenarios.\n",
    "### Continuous Evaluation\n",
    "Regularly assess and update security measures based on evolving threat landscapes.\n",
    "### Layered Defense\n",
    "Implement a multi-layered security approach to address different levels of threats.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Threat model\n",
    "- A threat model serves as a strategic framework that identifies potential attacks and adversaries a system aims to safeguard against.\n",
    "- Threat models help in understanding and preparing for various security risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./assets/threat-model.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of threat actors\n",
    "- Threat actors have varying capabilities. A hacking group backed by a nation has access to much more resources than someone hacking on their own.\n",
    "- Threat actors have varied motivations, ranging from financial gain to political or ideological reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./assets/threat-actor.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./assets/threat-profiling.jpg\" style=\"width: 50%;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "## Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure\n",
    "- CVD is an ethical practice where security researchers or individuals who discover vulnerabilities in a system responsibly report them to the affected organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bug bounty program\n",
    "- A Bug Bounty Program is a crowdsourced initiative where organizations offer rewards to ethical hackers (bug hunters) for responsibly discovering and reporting security vulnerabilities.\n",
    "- Bug bounty programs incentivize ethical hacking to improve cybersecurity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Patch adoption is slow\n",
    "- Organizations need some time before their systems are patched, and often this takes very long or is not done at all.\n",
    "    - Organizations do not know that they are running a service or that there is a patch.\n",
    "    - Organizations do not have clear patching guidelines and admins do it on a “best-effort” basis.\n",
    "- Because patching is slow, there is a window where organizations are vulnerable even after exploits are readily available.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Security by design\n",
    "- Security by design is an approach that integrates cybersecurity measures into the design and development processes of systems and applications from the outset.\n",
    "- Identifying and addressing security risks early in the development process leads to a more secure product.\n",
    "- Integrating security from the beginning is more cost-effective than retrofitting security measures later.\n",
    "- Regulatory requirements make it mandatory to think about security in an early stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Defense in Depth\n",
    "- Defense in Depth is a cybersecurity strategy that involves deploying multiple layers of security controls to protect against various types of threats.\n",
    "- This reduces the risk of a single security control failure compromising the entire system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usable security\n",
    "- Usable security is an approach that seeks to integrate effective cybersecurity measures while maintaining a positive and user-friendly experience.\n",
    "- You can have the best security measures there are, but if it is not usable people will work around them. This can create even more security risks."

    "## Network Security\n",
    "Network security is the protection of the underlying networking infrastructure from unauthorized access, misuse, or theft. It involves creating a secure infrastructure for devices, users, and applications to work in a secure manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A Network\n",
    "A network consists of two or more computers that are linked to share resources, exchange files, or allow electronic communications. The computers on a network may be linked through cables, telephone lines, radio waves satellites, or infrared light beams.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The OSI Model\n",
    "The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven abstraction layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./assets/osi-model.jpg\" width=\"10%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "- In practice we only use five layers.\n",
    "- Security is important for every single layer\n",
    "\n",
    "## The physical layer\n",
    "- Physical security is the first line of defense against unauthorized access, environmental hazards, and theft.\n",
    "- Without adequate physical security, even the most robust cybersecurity measures can be compromised.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Physical layer threats\n",
    "- Unauthorized access to the datacenter.\n",
    "- Devices can be stolen or modified.\n",
    "- People can watch what you are doing through the window.\n",
    "- It is important to identify where cables go, even more so in a shared office environment.\n",
    "- While working from home, equipment might be more vulnerable.\n",

    "- Cable testing\n",
    "\n",
    "### Electromagnetic Interference (EMI):\n",
    "Electrical devices, power cables, and other equipment emitting electromagnetic interference can negatively impact the performance of network cables. Proper cable shielding and\n",
    "separation from other electronic devices can minimize EMI.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rodent or Pest Damage:\n",
    "Rodents or pests may chew through cables, causing disruptions to network connectivity. Proper cable management and protective coverings can help prevent such damage.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Guided vs unguided media\n",
    "A guided medium is a communication channel where the signals are guided along a physical path.\n",
    "- Copper cables, fiber cables, ...\n",
    "- Physical access is needed to tamper with the data on the cable.\n",
    "\n",
    "An unguided medium refers to a communication channel where the signals propagate freely through the air or space.\n",
    "- Radio waves\n",
    "- Infrared waves\n",
    "- Access control on unguided media is hard\n",
    "\n",
    "Wireless security through range limitation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Directional antennas:\n",
    "Just because you cannot get a signal, it doesn’t mean no one can.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Signal security\n",
    "- Spread signals over multiple frequencies to counter jamming.\n",
    "- Frequency hopping aims to change frequencies very fast in a pattern that is unknown to an attacker.\n",
    "- Authenticating and encrypting data sent over wireless signals can ensure integrity and confidentiality."

    "Attacks on Avialability\n",
    "\n",
    "Availability can be attacked on every layer of the OSI model.\n",
    "- The best-known attack is a DDoS attack, overwhelming a system with a lot of traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such as:    - HTTP flood (Appication layer)\n",
    "            - TCP SYN flood (Transport layer)\n",
    "            - ICMP (Ping) Flood (Network layer)\n",
    "            - WiFi Deauthentication (Data link layer)\n",
    "            - Cut wire (Physical layer)\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a DoS attack?\n",
    "- A Denial of Service (DoS) attack overwhelms a target system with a flood of traffic,  rendering it unavailable to users.\n",
    "- Attackers aim to disrupt services, causing financial losses or reputational damage.\n",
    "\n",
    "DDoS – Cheap to perform, expensive to mitigate\n",
    "## Types of DoS attacks\n",
    "- Volumetric Attacks\n",
    "    - Overwhelm victims with a high volume of traffic.\n",
    "    Ex: Amplification attack\n",
    "- Protocol Attacks\n",
    "    - Exploit vulnerabilities in network protocols.\n",
    "    Ex: TCP SYN Flood\n",
    "- Application Layer Attacks\n",
    "    - Target specific applications to exhaust resources.\n",
    "    - Application layer attacks specifically target the highest layer of the OSI model, focusing on the application and services provided to end-users.\n",
    "    - The traffic generated by this attack is harder to identify as malicious traffic, as it closely resembles normal user traffic.\n",
    "    EX: HTTP Flood\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of DoS attacks - Amplification attack\n",
    "- How can attackers overwhelm victims with a high volume of traffic?\n",
    "- One way is to use an intermediary server that returns a large response to a query to create an Amplification attack.\n",
    "- Requirements for this attack are:\n",
    "    - A server that provides large responses on small queries.\n",
    "    - The ability to spoof an IP address.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can be done with many protocols, commonly over UDP.\n",
    "- A popular protocol is DNS, where the attacker spoofs the IP address of a victim.\n",
    "- DNS response to a TXT query (+- 21 times amplification)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of DoS attacks - Protocol attack\n",
    "- Instead of congesting the Internet line, attackers also target protocols to drain resources of a system to the point where the system no longer functions.\n",
    "- These attacks do not need as much bandwidth as volumetric attacks but do need some exploitable element in a protocol.\n",
    "- Targets the Network and Transport layer.\n",
    "- A common protocol attack is the TCP SYN Flood.\n",
    "    - Send many SYN packets to overwhelm the server, becaues some memory is allocated for each connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Defenses – TCP SYN Cookies\n",
    "    - Increasing the amount of “waiting” connections does not protect us. We need to shift the burden away from our server.\n",
    "        - For each SYN packet Put some cryptographic value in the sequence number\n",
    "        - Verify the value from the ACK number.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Measuring TCP SYN Floods:\n",
    "The target of the SYN flood attack will replay to those random ips wiht SYN-ACK.\n",
    "- SYN-ACKs scatter over the Internet, being sent to random IP addresses.\n",
    "- If we have a lot of IP addresses, we can identify ongoing attacks.\n",
    "- This traffic is called backscatter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of DoS attacks - HTTP Flood\n",
    "- In a HTTP Flood, the attacker requests many pages, images, and/or other (large) files from a website at once.\n",
    "- As the attacker must complete the TCP handshake to do this, the attack cannot be spoofed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## DDoS Mitigation\n",
    "- Redundant network infrastructures ensure that a single point of failure cannot bring down the entire system.\n",
    "- Traffic filtering aims to identify malicious packets and block them.\n",
    "- Content Delivery Networks distribute and cache content over a large network, which can absorb and mitigate the DDoS traffic by serving content from distributed servers.\n",
    "- Web Application Firewalls can protect against application layer attacks by identifying malicious traffic.\n",

    "\n",
    "# Botnets\n",
    "- Definition: A botnet is a network of compromised computers (bots) that are under the control of a single entity, usually a malicious actor.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Architecture of a botnet\n",
    "- Infected devices (bots)\n",
    "    - Can be any device: IoT, PC, Phones, ...\n",
    "- Command and control (C2 or C&C) infrastructure\n",
    "    - The bots receive commands through the C2 infrastructure.\n",
    "- Communication channels\n",
    "    - Many protocols/methods are used: IRC, HTTP, P2P, Blockchain, ...\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mitigating botnets\n",
    "- Securing many devices to make harder to compromise a large number of devices.\n",
    "- Mirai was successful due to trivial security measures.\n",
    "- Taking down command and control infrastructure.\n",
    "- The servers are often located in multiple countries and require collaboration between law-enforcement agencies.\n",
    "- Blocklisting devices that are infected by a botnet so that owners clean them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA)\n",
    "- A static domain name or IP address can be blocked.\n",
    "- Malware authors generate many domain names and only have to register one.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Peer to peer architecture\n",
    "- Command and Control servers might be taken down.\n",
    "- Using the bots as C2 channel makes the botnet redundant.\n",

    "# Firewalls\n",
    "In computing, a firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. \n",
    "A firewall typically establishes a barrier between a trusted network and an untrusted network, such as the Internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a firewall?\n",
    "- Firewalls divide the untrusted outside of a network from the more trusted interior of a network.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Often, they run on dedicated devices:\n",
    "    - Less possibilities for compromise – no compilers, linkers, loaders, debuggers, programming libraries, or other tools an attacker might use to escalate their attack.\n",
    "    - Easier to maintain with a few accounts.\n",
    "    - Physically divide the inside from outside of a network.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The importance of firewalls\n",
    "- It prevents (vulnerable) services to be accessed from outside the network.\n",
    "- It segments networks.\n",
    "- It reduces the attack surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Firewall rules example\n",
    "- The website at 192.168.1.5 should be reachable from the Internet.\n",
    "- The Internal DNS server at 192.168.1.8 should be able to reach other DNS servers.\n",
    "- Other connections should be denied.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Firewall in the network model\n",
    "- A firewall compares network traffic to a set of rules. To match the rules to the traffic, it must process several packet layers to obtain the needed data.\n",
    "- For example: to allow the webserver to be reached, packets need to be processed up to the transport layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Linux firewall: IPTables\n",
    "- A user-space program that allows administrators to configure packet filter rules of the Linux kernel firewall.\n",

    "- Firewalls can be implemented in Software or Hardware:\n",
    "    - Software – Slower, but easier to deploy on single machines.\n",

    "- The simplest type of firewall – compares packet header information to a set of rules.\n",
    "- Very fast – A minimal amount of processing is required. \n",
    "- Many rules are needed, making the firewall hard to maintain and prone to human error.\n",
    "- Allows access to services based on network data, does not allow for the blocking of specific application commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of firewalls – stateful inspection firewall\n",
    "- Maintains state between packets, allowing for more complex rules.\n",
    "- Similar to packet filtering but remembers past events, allowing for rules that allow traffic from outside if the connection was started from inside the network.\n",
    "- Stateful inspection firewalls can be used to keep track of TCP sequence numbers and block connections that are acting suspicious.\n",
    "- Some stateful firewalls can inspect a limited amount of application-layer data for well-known protocols.\n",

    "- Tools such as ZMap can be used to scan the entire Internet very quickly, even as fast as 6 minutes from a single machine.\n",
    "- Search engines such as Censys and Shodan provide databases of running services on the Internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Internet-wide scanning detection\n",
    "- People are scanning the entire Internet, so every IP address will see these scanning packets.\n",
    "- By looking at network traffic we can identify unsolicited packets. If we monitor on many IP addresses, we get a good overview of who is scanning the Internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "# De-Militarized Zone (DMZ)\n",
    "- A DMZ is common in network architectures to allow some services to be reached from the Internet.\n",
    "- The Internal network is separated from the DMZ using a second firewall, which can be used for more stringent filtering.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Different levels of security\n",
    "- For your companies “crown jewels”, physically separating infrastructure can be key to keep them safe.\n",
    "- High value systems are “air-gapped” and can only be accessed from specific terminals that are physically protected.\n",
    "- Data diodes can allow traffic to flow in, but no traffic to flow out.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Virtual Private Network (VPN)\n",
    "- Accessing a (corporate) network from the outside is dangerous and therefore (usually) firewalled.\n",
    "- Sometimes is required to link multiple facility networks over the Internet or provide employees with a way to work from multiple places securely.\n",
    "- A VPN can be used to encrypt data on lower layers to create a “transparent” tunnel that allows users to connect securely to a LAN network over the Internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **IPSec** is a protocol that adds an extra part to the Network layer, allowing to connectthrough a firewall onto a network.\n",

    "Firewalls aim to prevent attacks by reducing attack surface, but do not often detect attacks.\n",
    "    - You cannot block all traffic in a firewall.\n",
    "    - Attacks have multiple stages, all allowing for detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intrusion detection system (IDS)\n",
    "An intrusion detection system is a device or software application that monitors a network or systems for malicious activity or policy violations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of intrusion detection systems\n",
    "- An IDS can be either:\n",
    "    - Host-based (HIDS) – Monitors events on a host, such as system logs.\n",
    "    - Network-based (NIDS) – Monitors network data and can use deep-packet inspection to identify malicious activity.\n",
    "- IDS can have different types:\n",
    "    - Heuristic – Matches data to pre-defined rules.\n",
    "    - Signature – Matches data to known indicators (e.g. flagged IP addresses)\n",
    "    - Anomaly – Determines what is “normal data” and identifies data that deviates from the norm.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Anomaly detection\n",
    "- Starts by gathering base-line data to consider as “normal”.\n",
    "- Classifies data using a variety of approaches:\n",
    "    - Statistical – using various mathematical models.\n",
    "    - Knowledge based – relying on expert knowledge to classify observed behavior.\n",
    "    - Machine-learning – Automatically determine whether the observed data matches the baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Alert fatigue is a big problem\n",
    "- Too many alarms lead to a situation where analysts do not have the time to investigate them.\n",
    "- Difficult trade-off between the sensitivity of an IDS and the number of False Positives generated by the system.\n",
    "- Some insurance policies will not cover attacks that you knew about but did nothing to mitigate.\n",
    "- Too much noise in an IDS can be a liability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Host-based IDS\n",
    "- Monitors activity on a system.\n",
    "- A virus scanner is a type of HIDS.\n",
    "- Common data sources for a HIDS include:\n",
    "    - System call traces\n",
    "    - Log files\n",
    "    - Integrity checksums\n",
    "    - Registry access patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "### Distributed HIDS\n",
    "- A distributed HIDS collects all data of various systems in the same place to create a more effective IDS.\n",
    "- This requires devices in the network to run programs that collect telemetry and forward it to a central location.\n",
    "- There can be privacy concerns when collecting information about the systems of employees.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Network-based IDS\n",
    "- Monitors activity on a network.\n",

    "- The location of the sensor matters a lot.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sending traffic to a NIDS\n",
    "- Switches have SPAN ports that can be used to copy all data received on the switch.\n",
    "- If the switch receives more data than the SPAN port or the ethernet cable can handle, the data is not complete.\n",
    "- A wiretap on the raw network line will also provide a copy of the data and might be more complete.\n",

    "    - Divert attackers away from accessing real systems.\n",
    "    - Collect information about the goals of an attacker.\n",
    "    - Alert administrators of strange behavior.\n",
    "- Honeypots are set up such that there is no reason to ever contact them, so if they are contacted there is a reasonable chance that it is malicious.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Location of sensors in a network\n",
    "- Sensors can be placed in many parts of the network:\n",
    "    - Behind the border firewall or at the level of the border firewall.\n",
    "    - In the DMZ.\n",

    "- Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) are protocols for securing communication over the web.\n",
    "- It gives the S to HTTPS(ecure).\n",
    "- It can encrypt, secure, and authenticate communications on the Internet by transparently adding security to the transport layer.\n",
    "- It was standardized in 1995.\n",
    "\n",
    "## SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) are cryptographic protocols for secure communication over a network. Key differences include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Version**: SSL is older (e.g., SSL 3.0) while TLS is newer (e.g., TLS 1.0+).\n",
    "- **Security**: TLS is more secure, addressing vulnerabilities in SSL.\n",
    "- **Algorithms**: SSL had fixed algorithms; TLS supports a wider range and is more flexible.\n",
    "- **Handshake Process**: TLS handshake is more secure and efficient.\n",
    "- **Ports**: SSL uses designated ports; TLS can use the same port as non-secure traffic.\n",
    "- **Deprecation**: SSL is deprecated due to security flaws; TLS (up to 1.3) is recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"SSL\" is often used to refer to both SSL and TLS, especially regarding \"SSL certificates,\" which are actually TLS certificates. However, TLS is the protocol of choice for enhanced security.\n",

    "## HTTPS – SSL/TLS handshake\n",
    "- The client sends a “Client Hello” message to the server, including the client’s SSL/TLS version and supported cipher suites.\n",
    "- The server responds with a “Server Hello” message, including the server’s SSL/TLS version and selected cipher suite.\n",
    "- The server sends its SSL/TLS certificate to the client, which includes the server’s public key.\n",

    "- SSL/TLS relies on cryptographic certificates.\n",
    "- Certificates are signed by trusted parties, and applications specify which Certificate Authority is trusted.\n",
    "- The idea behind SSL/TLS is that the certificate issuer is a trusted party.\n",
    "- If a Root CA is compromised, the whole system is compromised.\n",
    "- Being widely deployed also provides a large attack surface for attackers if an exploit is found.\n",

    "- The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network.\n",
    "- It translates domain names to IP addresses, which are required to locate and identify computer services and devices with the underlying network protocols.\n",
    "\n",
    "## DNS Poisoning\n",
    "- DNS poisoning is a type of attack that exploits vulnerabilities in the domain name system (DNS) to divert Internet traffic away from legitimate servers and towards fake ones.\n",
    "- Attackers can use DNS poisoning to redirect users to malicious websites, steal sensitive information, or launch other cyber attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recursive and authoritative DNS servers\n",
    "- Recursive DNS servers are responsible for resolving DNS queries by querying other DNS servers on behalf of the client.\n",
