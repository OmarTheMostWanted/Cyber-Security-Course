    "## What is computer security?\n",
    "- Computer security deals with protecting data, programs, and systems against intelligent adversaries.\n",
    "- We become increasingly interconnected, and digitalization is increasing, making the consequences of security failures catastrophic.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Safety vs Security:\n",
    "- Safety means being secure against unintended threats.\n",
    "- Security is the protection against deliberate threats.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why is security hard?\n",
    "- Security is hard to test for.\n",
    "- Building secure applications requires deep understanding of all technologies involved in the design and implementation of the system.\n",
    "    - One vulnerability can cripple the system.\n",
    "    - Not all dependencies are known.\n",
    "- It is not all technical, users play a role too.\n",
    "- There is asymmetry between attackers and defenders\n",
    "\n",
    "## Security principles: CIA triad\n",
    "- The CIA triad contains the three essential goals in Cyber Security.\n",
    "- Systems must be **available** to users, users should be able to **trust** (verify) that the data is correct, and data should **not be accessed by unauthorized** persons.\n",
    "\n",
    "![CIA Triad](./CIA-triad.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools for Confidentiality\n",
    "- Encryption\n",
    "    - Ensure that data cannot be read when someone gets their hands on it.\n",
    "- Access control systems\n",
    "    - Make it hard to get the data when the user is unauthorized.\n",
    "- Policies and governance\n",
    "    - Mandate secure data practices\n",
    " \n",
    "### Tools for Integrity\n",
    "- Data validation\n",
    "    - Validate data at various stages to ensure that it is still intact.\n",
    "    - Tools include Checksums, Digital signatures, Error detection and correction codes.\n",
    "- Change management and version control\n",
    "    - Control and document changes to data to ensure transparency and accountability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools for Availability\n",
    "- Redundancy and failover\n",
    "    - Design systems with backup mechanisms to mitigate single points of failure.\n",
    "- Load balancing\n",
    "    - Distribute traffic across various resources.\n",
    "- Monitoring and alerting\n",
    "    - Monitor for early signs of problems to identify system failures before they become a large issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Computer security threat\n",
    "### Threat definition\n",
    "- Threats are potential violations of security posed by attackers.\n",
    "- When evaluating the security of a program or website, it's essential to consider the context:\n",
    "    Who is the potential attacker, and what are you defending against?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Context is Crucial\n",
    "- Computer security is context-dependent and revolves around a specific attacker or threat model.\n",
    "- There is no universal solution that can defend against all types of threats.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Attackers have different profiles and motives\n",
    "- Consider different potential attackers, each with unique motivations and capabilities.\n",
    "- When evaluating the security of a program or website, it's essential to consider the context: Who is the potential attacker, and what are you defending against?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### No One-Size-Fits-All\n",
    "Recognize that security measures should be tailored to specific threats and scenarios.\n",
    "### Continuous Evaluation\n",
    "Regularly assess and update security measures based on evolving threat landscapes.\n",
    "### Layered Defense\n",
    "Implement a multi-layered security approach to address different levels of threats.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Threat model\n",
    "- A threat model serves as a strategic framework that identifies potential attacks and adversaries a system aims to safeguard against.\n",
    "- Threat models help in understanding and preparing for various security risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Threat model](./threat-model.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of threat actors\n",
    "- Threat actors have varying capabilities. A hacking group backed by a nation has access to much more resources than someone hacking on their own.\n",
    "- Threat actors have varied motivations, ranging from financial gain to political or ideological reasons.\n",
    "![Threat actor](./threat-actor.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "![Threat Profiling](./threat-profiling.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure\n",
    "- CVD is an ethical practice where security researchers or individuals who discover vulnerabilities in a system responsibly report them to the affected organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bug bounty program\n",
    "- A Bug Bounty Program is a crowdsourced initiative where organizations offer rewards to ethical hackers (bug hunters) for responsibly discovering and reporting security vulnerabilities.\n",
    "- Bug bounty programs incentivize ethical hacking to improve cybersecurity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Patch adoption is slow\n",
    "- Organizations need some time before their systems are patched, and often this takes very long or is not done at all.\n",
    "    - Organizations do not know that they are running a service or that there is a patch.\n",
    "    - Organizations do not have clear patching guidelines and admins do it on a “best-effort” basis.\n",
    "- Because patching is slow, there is a window where organizations are vulnerable even after exploits are readily available.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Security by design\n",
    "- Security by design is an approach that integrates cybersecurity measures into the design and development processes of systems and applications from the outset.\n",
    "- Identifying and addressing security risks early in the development process leads to a more secure product.\n",
    "- Integrating security from the beginning is more cost-effective than retrofitting security measures later.\n",
    "- Regulatory requirements make it mandatory to think about security in an early stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Defense in Depth\n",
    "- Defense in Depth is a cybersecurity strategy that involves deploying multiple layers of security controls to protect against various types of threats.\n",
    "- This reduces the risk of a single security control failure compromising the entire system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usable security\n",
    "- Usable security is an approach that seeks to integrate effective cybersecurity measures while maintaining a positive and user-friendly experience.\n",
    "- You can have the best security measures there are, but if it is not usable people will work around them. This can create even more security risks.\n",

    "## Network Security\n",
    "Network security is the protection of the underlying networking infrastructure from unauthorized access, misuse, or theft. It involves creating a secure infrastructure for devices, users, and applications to work in a secure manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A Network\n",
    "A network consists of two or more computers that are linked to share resources, exchange files, or allow electronic communications. The computers on a network may be linked through cables, telephone lines, radio waves satellites, or infrared light beams.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The OSI Model\n",
    "The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven abstraction layers.\n",

    "<img src=\"osi-model.jpg\" width=\"30%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "- In practice we only use five layers.\n",
    "- Security is important for every single layer\n",
    "\n",
    "## The physical layer\n",
    "- Physical security is the first line of defense against unauthorized access, environmental hazards, and theft.\n",
    "- Without adequate physical security, even the most robust cybersecurity measures can be compromised.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Physical layer threats\n",
    "- Unauthorized access to the datacenter.\n",
    "- Devices can be stolen or modified.\n",

    "## Guided vs unguided media\n",
    "A guided medium is a communication channel where the signals are guided along a physical path.\n",
    "- Copper cables, fiber cables, ...\n",
    "- Physical access is needed to tamper with the data on the cable.\n",
    "\n",
    "An unguided medium refers to a communication channel where the signals propagate freely through the air or space.\n",
    "- Radio waves\n",
    "- Infrared waves\n",
    "- Access control on unguided media is hard\n",

    "Directional antennas:\n",
    "Just because you cannot get a signal, it doesn’t mean no one can.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Signal security\n",
    "- Spread signals over multiple frequencies to counter jamming.\n",
    "- Frequency hopping aims to change frequencies very fast in a pattern that is unknown to an attacker.\n",
    "- Authenticating and encrypting data sent over wireless signals can ensure integrity and confidentiality."

    "Attacks on Avialability\n",
    "\n",
    "Availability can be attacked on every layer of the OSI model.\n",
    "- The best-known attack is a DDoS attack, overwhelming a system with a lot of traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such as:    - HTTP flood (Appication layer)\n",
    "            - TCP SYN flood (Transport layer)\n",

    "\n",
    "## What is a DoS attack?\n",
    "- A Denial of Service (DoS) attack overwhelms a target system with a flood of traffic,  rendering it unavailable to users.\n",
    "- Attackers aim to disrupt services, causing financial losses or reputational damage.\n",
    "\n",
    "DDoS – Cheap to perform, expensive to mitigate\n",
    "## Types of DoS attacks\n",
    "- Volumetric Attacks\n",
    "    - Overwhelm victims with a high volume of traffic.\n",
    "    Ex: Amplification attack\n",
    "- Protocol Attacks\n",
    "    - Exploit vulnerabilities in network protocols.\n",
    "    Ex: TCP SYN Flood\n",
    "- Application Layer Attacks\n",
    "    - Target specific applications to exhaust resources.\n",
    "    - Application layer attacks specifically target the highest layer of the OSI model, focusing on the application and services provided to end-users.\n",
    "    - The traffic generated by this attack is harder to identify as malicious traffic, as it closely resembles normal user traffic.\n",
    "    EX: HTTP Flood\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of DoS attacks - Amplification attack\n",
    "- How can attackers overwhelm victims with a high volume of traffic?\n",
    "- One way is to use an intermediary server that returns a large response to a query to create an Amplification attack.\n",
    "- Requirements for this attack are:\n",
    "    - A server that provides large responses on small queries.\n",
    "    - The ability to spoof an IP address.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can be done with many protocols, commonly over UDP.\n",
    "- A popular protocol is DNS, where the attacker spoofs the IP address of a victim.\n",
    "- DNS response to a TXT query (+- 21 times amplification)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of DoS attacks - Protocol attack\n",
    "- Instead of congesting the Internet line, attackers also target protocols to drain resources of a system to the point where the system no longer functions.\n",
    "- These attacks do not need as much bandwidth as volumetric attacks but do need some exploitable element in a protocol.\n",
    "- Targets the Network and Transport layer.\n",
    "- A common protocol attack is the TCP SYN Flood.\n",
    "    - Send many SYN packets to overwhelm the server, becaues some memory is allocated for each connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Defenses – TCP SYN Cookies\n",
    "    - Increasing the amount of “waiting” connections does not protect us. We need to shift the burden away from our server.\n",
    "        - For each SYN packet Put some cryptographic value in the sequence number\n",
    "        - Verify the value from the ACK number.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Measuring TCP SYN Floods:\n",
    "The target of the SYN flood attack will replay to those random ips wiht SYN-ACK.\n",
    "- SYN-ACKs scatter over the Internet, being sent to random IP addresses.\n",
    "- If we have a lot of IP addresses, we can identify ongoing attacks.\n",
    "- This traffic is called backscatter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of DoS attacks - HTTP Flood\n",
    "- In a HTTP Flood, the attacker requests many pages, images, and/or other (large) files from a website at once.\n",
    "- As the attacker must complete the TCP handshake to do this, the attack cannot be spoofed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## DDoS Mitigation\n",
    "- Redundant network infrastructures ensure that a single point of failure cannot bring down the entire system.\n",
    "- Traffic filtering aims to identify malicious packets and block them.\n",
    "- Content Delivery Networks distribute and cache content over a large network, which can absorb and mitigate the DDoS traffic by serving content from distributed servers.\n",

    "# Firewalls\n",
    "In computing, a firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. \n",
    "A firewall typically establishes a barrier between a trusted network and an untrusted network, such as the Internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a firewall?\n",
    "- Firewalls divide the untrusted outside of a network from the more trusted interior of a network.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Often, they run on dedicated devices:\n",
    "    - Less possibilities for compromise – no compilers, linkers, loaders, debuggers, programming libraries, or other tools an attacker might use to escalate their attack.\n",
    "    - Easier to maintain with a few accounts.\n",
    "    - Physically divide the inside from outside of a network.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The importance of firewalls\n",
    "- It prevents (vulnerable) services to be accessed from outside the network.\n",
    "- It segments networks.\n",
    "- It reduces the attack surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Firewall rules example\n",
    "- The website at 192.168.1.5 should be reachable from the Internet.\n",
    "- The Internal DNS server at 192.168.1.8 should be able to reach other DNS servers.\n",
    "- Other connections should be denied.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Firewall in the network model\n",
    "- A firewall compares network traffic to a set of rules. To match the rules to the traffic, it must process several packet layers to obtain the needed data.\n",
    "- For example: to allow the webserver to be reached, packets need to be processed up to the transport layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Linux firewall: IPTables\n",
    "- A user-space program that allows administrators to configure packet filter rules of the Linux kernel firewall.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of firewalls\n",
    "- Firewalls can be implemented in Software or Hardware:\n",
    "    - Software – Slower, but easier to deploy on single machines.\n",
    "    - Hardware – Faster, can be safer, but expensive.\n",
    "- Firewalls can differ in the amount of Network Layers they process:\n",
    "    - Packet size (data link layer)\n",
    "    - MAC (data link layer) and IP (IP layer) filtering\n",
    "    - Port filtering (transport layer)\n",
    "    - Deep packet (application layer)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of firewalls – packet filtering firewall\n",
    "- The simplest type of firewall – compares packet header information to a set of rules.\n",
    "- Very fast – A minimal amount of processing is required. \n",
    "- Many rules are needed, making the firewall hard to maintain and prone to human error.\n",
    "- Allows access to services based on network data, does not allow for the blocking of specific application commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of firewalls – stateful inspection firewall\n",
    "- Maintains state between packets, allowing for more complex rules.\n",
    "- Similar to packet filtering but remembers past events, allowing for rules that allow traffic from outside if the connection was started from inside the network.\n",
    "- Stateful inspection firewalls can be used to keep track of TCP sequence numbers and block connections that are acting suspicious.\n",
    "- Some stateful firewalls can inspect a limited amount of application-layer data for well-known protocols.\n",
    "- Keeping state is more expensive than simply packet filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of firewalls – application-level gateway\n",
    "- Also called application proxy.\n",
    "- Relays application layer data between user and application.\n",
    "- Can be used to block specific features of an application that you do not want to be used.\n",
    "- Requires a lot of processing and does not scale well as it needs to be able to parse the application context.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of firewalls – circuit-level gateway\n",
    "- Also called circuit-level proxy.\n",
    "- Relays application layer data between user and application.\n",
    "- Does not parse the application layer contents, but determines which connections are allowed.\n",
    "- An example of such a firewall is a SOCKS proxy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### SOCKS proxy\n",
    "    1. A user authenticates with the proxy.\n",
    "    2. The user requests a specific IP and port.\n",
    "    3. If the user is allowed to make that connection, the proxy sets up a connection to the IP and port and relays the application-layer data.\n",

    "## Firewall use-case – TCP SYN scan\n",
    "Attackers often scan a network to find vulnerable services.\n",
    "- Using a stateful firewall to block excessive scanning (and bruteforcing).\n",
    "- If attackers scan slow enough, they will still be able to scan the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Internet-wide scanning\n",
    "- Tools such as ZMap can be used to scan the entire Internet very quickly, even as fast as 6 minutes from a single machine.\n",
    "- Search engines such as Censys and Shodan provide databases of running services on the Internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Internet-wide scanning detection\n",
    "- People are scanning the entire Internet, so every IP address will see these scanning packets.\n",
    "- By looking at network traffic we can identify unsolicited packets. If we monitor on many IP addresses, we get a good overview of who is scanning the Internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "# De-Militarized Zone (DMZ)\n",
    "- A DMZ is common in network architectures to allow some services to be reached from the Internet.\n",
    "- The Internal network is separated from the DMZ using a second firewall, which can be used for more stringent filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Different levels of security\n",
    "- For your companies “crown jewels”, physically separating infrastructure can be key to keep them safe.\n",
    "- High value systems are “air-gapped” and can only be accessed from specific terminals that are physically protected.\n",
    "- Data diodes can allow traffic to flow in, but no traffic to flow out.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Virtual Private Network (VPN)\n",
    "- Accessing a (corporate) network from the outside is dangerous and therefore (usually) firewalled.\n",
    "- Sometimes is required to link multiple facility networks over the Internet or provide employees with a way to work from multiple places securely.\n",
    "- A VPN can be used to encrypt data on lower layers to create a “transparent” tunnel that allows users to connect securely to a LAN network over the Internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **IPSec** is a protocol that adds an extra part to the Network layer, allowing to connectthrough a firewall onto a network.\n",
    "- It is usually cheaper than having private Internet cables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Intrusion Detection\n",
    "Firewalls aim to prevent attacks by reducing attack surface, but do not often detect attacks.\n",
    "    - You cannot block all traffic in a firewall.\n",
    "    - Attacks have multiple stages, all allowing for detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intrusion detection system (IDS)\n",
    "An intrusion detection system is a device or software application that monitors a network or systems for malicious activity or policy violations.\n",

    "## Types of intrusion detection systems\n",
    "- An IDS can be either:\n",
    "    - Host-based (HIDS) – Monitors events on a host, such as system logs.\n",
    "    - Network-based (NIDS) – Monitors network data and can use deep-packet inspection to identify malicious activity.\n",
    "- IDS can have different types:\n",
    "    - Heuristic – Matches data to pre-defined rules.\n",
    "    - Signature – Matches data to known indicators (e.g. flagged IP addresses)\n",
    "    - Anomaly – Determines what is “normal data” and identifies data that deviates from the norm.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Anomaly detection\n",
    "- Starts by gathering base-line data to consider as “normal”.\n",
    "- Classifies data using a variety of approaches:\n",
    "    - Statistical – using various mathematical models.\n",
    "    - Knowledge based – relying on expert knowledge to classify observed behavior.\n",
    "    - Machine-learning – Automatically determine whether the observed data matches the baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Alert fatigue is a big problem\n",
    "- Too many alarms lead to a situation where analysts do not have the time to investigate them.\n",
    "- Difficult trade-off between the sensitivity of an IDS and the number of False Positives generated by the system.\n",
    "- Some insurance policies will not cover attacks that you knew about but did nothing to mitigate.\n",
    "- Too much noise in an IDS can be a liability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Host-based IDS\n",
    "- Monitors activity on a system.\n",
    "- A virus scanner is a type of HIDS.\n",
    "- Common data sources for a HIDS include:\n",
    "    - System call traces\n",
    "    - Log files\n",
    "    - Integrity checksums\n",
    "    - Registry access patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "### Distributed HIDS\n",
    "- A distributed HIDS collects all data of various systems in the same place to create a more effective IDS.\n",
    "- This requires devices in the network to run programs that collect telemetry and forward it to a central location.\n",
    "- There can be privacy concerns when collecting information about the systems of employees.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Network-based IDS\n",
    "- Monitors activity on a network.\n",
    "- Two types of sensors:\n",
    "    - Inline    \n",
    "    - Passive\n",
    "- The location of the sensor matters a lot.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sending traffic to a NIDS\n",
    "- Switches have SPAN ports that can be used to copy all data received on the switch.\n",
    "- If the switch receives more data than the SPAN port or the ethernet cable can handle, the data is not complete.\n",
    "- A wiretap on the raw network line will also provide a copy of the data and might be more complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Honeypots\n",
    "- A honeypot is a decoy system that is designed to lure potential attackers away from critical systems.\n",
    "- A honeypot has several goals: \n",
    "    - Divert attackers away from accessing real systems.\n",
    "    - Collect information about the goals of an attacker.\n",
    "    - Alert administrators of strange behavior.\n",
    "- Honeypots are set up such that there is no reason to ever contact them, so if they are contacted there is a reasonable chance that it is malicious.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Location of sensors in a network\n",
    "- Sensors can be placed in many parts of the network:\n",
    "    - Behind the border firewall or at the level of the border firewall.\n",
    "    - In the DMZ.\n",
    "    - In a specific part of the network, such as the network segment with employee devices.\n",
    "- The traffic collected is different at every point, depending on the threat profile of the organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Recap\n",
    "- Firewalls are useful to limit the attack surface in a network.\n",
    "- What Internet scanning is and how it is blocked using a firewall.\n",
    "- Different intrusion detection systems and what they are used for.\n"
